	\section{Introduction}
	RFDist is implemented and there are no known issues.
	\section{Implementation}
	The program is implemented with python. The trees are read by a Newick-parser from Bio.Phylo and afterwards translated into a self coded structure of nodes.\\
	The program uses Day's algorithm as explained in the lecture to compute the distance.\\
	We did the validation by testing the given trees and getting reasonable results in the experiments.\\
	You can run it by invoking main.py with python3 and either give the files that contains the trees as arguments or type their names when the program asks for them.
